                <p>This is a short but extremely intense book, first published in 1946.</p>

                <p>Viktor Emil Frankl (1905-1997) an Austrian Jew, neurologist, psychiatrist and a Holocaust survivor, is saying in this 1946 originally-published book, Man’s Search for Meaning. He says that the life of each one of us has its own meaning.</p>

                <p>In this book, he said that he and the other survivors kept themselves alive by imaging and looking forward to their lives after the war. Those who felt hopeless and they could not picture themselves reuniting with their families after the war, perished.</p>

                <p>As if they had no longer any reason for living and thus they chose to die rather than to survive.</p>

                <p>one of the most important books of our time, Victor Frankl develops a philosophical argument that results in a very basic premise: happiness is a choice that humans can make, regardless of their circumstances.</p>

                <p>He also said that we should not ask for the meaning of our life. Rather, we should ask what life wants from us.</p>

                     <p>The Last Lecture is Randy Pausch’s last hurrah- a final note to the world and his family about how to live, love and let go.</p>

<p>He was a popular professor at Carnegie Mellon and was invited to give a “last lecture”, a tradition of sorts where a professor is urged to give a specially prepared lecture as though it were the last s/he were to ever give.</p>

<p>And so they are encouraged to break down all the knowledge learned in their lives and during their careers into one hour-long presentation and say, “this is the best of what I know, here you go.”</p>

<p>But for Randy Pausch, his Last Lecture became somewhat of a sensation because shortly before he was scheduled to give his presentation, he learned that he had late-stage pancreatic cancer and he only had 3-6 months left to live.</p>

                  <p>Thus, almost every page is stuffed with quotes, analysis, quotes of analysis, and analysis of quotes.</p>
