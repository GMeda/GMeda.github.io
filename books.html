                <img src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_237/https://www.shubz.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Mans-Search-for-Meaning-by-Viktor-Frankl-237x420.jpg" alt="book">

                <p>This is a short but extremely intense book, first published in 1946.</p>

                <p>Viktor Emil Frankl (1905-1997) an Austrian Jew, neurologist, psychiatrist and a Holocaust survivor, is saying in this 1946 originally-published book, Man’s Search for Meaning. He says that the life of each one of us has its own meaning.</p>

                <p>In this book, he said that he and the other survivors kept themselves alive by imaging and looking forward to their lives after the war. Those who felt hopeless and they could not picture themselves reuniting with their families after the war, perished.</p>

                <p>As if they had no longer any reason for living and thus they chose to die rather than to survive.</p>

                <p>one of the most important books of our time, Victor Frankl develops a philosophical argument that results in a very basic premise: happiness is a choice that humans can make, regardless of their circumstances.</p>

                <p>He also said that we should not ask for the meaning of our life. Rather, we should ask what life wants from us.</p>

                     <p>The Last Lecture is Randy Pausch’s last hurrah- a final note to the world and his family about how to live, love and let go.</p>

<p>He was a popular professor at Carnegie Mellon and was invited to give a “last lecture”, a tradition of sorts where a professor is urged to give a specially prepared lecture as though it were the last s/he were to ever give.</p>

<p>And so they are encouraged to break down all the knowledge learned in their lives and during their careers into one hour-long presentation and say, “this is the best of what I know, here you go.”</p>

<p>But for Randy Pausch, his Last Lecture became somewhat of a sensation because shortly before he was scheduled to give his presentation, he learned that he had late-stage pancreatic cancer and he only had 3-6 months left to live.</p>

                 <p>Ayn Rand’s The Fountainhead is an exalted view of her Objectivist philosophy, portraying a visionary artist struggling against the dull, conformist dogma of his peers; a book of ambition, power, gold and love.</p>

                  <p>The characters are fascinating, very well-developed, and the story is at times gripping. The story of Fountain Head is not sacrificed to create an ethical treatise.</p>

                  <p>The characters are fascinating, very well-developed, and the story is at times gripping. This epic story of money, power and a man’s struggle to succeed on his own terms is a paean to individualism and humanity’s creative potential.</p>

                  <p>This books helps you realize the pain and agony of a person who stands on his own beliefs, defying the society rules and so called modern world culture.</p>

                <p>For anyone who reads not only to escape reality but also to understand reality, The Alchemist can offer the best of both worlds.</p>

                <p>The events of the novel sit just on the borderline of miraculous and the ambience is simply just not that of our humdrum teenage world.</p>

                <p>However, The Alchemist also supplies insight and inspiration that extends beyond Santiago’s Sahara and into all lives, whether young, old, or teenager.</p>

                <p>The author differentiates throughout the entire book explaining how his best friend’s dad, the “Rich Dad” was so successful.</p>

                <p>One of the main significances that were emphasized was “working hard” was different from “working and spending smart”.</p>

                <p>For example, you can be the hardest worker in the building, but, if you are not smart on managing your money, you can have nothing to show for it.</p>

                  <p>Has your life ever been changed by a book? The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius will change your life. Books that do this are necessarily rare.</p>

                  <p>But even rarer than books that change your life are the books that change the way you understand life changing books.</p>

                  <p>If you want to better understand Marcus Aurelius, you want to read this book. Marcus’s stoic ‘collaborators,’ Epictetus and Seneca, show up in this book almost as frequently as Marcus.</p>

                  <p>Hadot does not glibly summarize these philosopher’s views, he is interested in letting the ancients speak for themselves.</p>

                  <p>Thus, almost every page is stuffed with quotes, analysis, quotes of analysis, and analysis of quotes.</p>

                   <p>Certainly there is love inpeace. It is the time of children, serenity, growth. The mother peacefully raising her children. The farmer lovingly tending his fields.</p>

                    <p>The elderly passing their final days in comfort surrounded by family. But there is love in war as well. The love for one’s country.</p>

                    <p>Such is a person’s violent attachment to their motherland that they will die for it. To give up your own life so another should live, that is love indeed</p>
