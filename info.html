              Search for TV news clips and other video bits from more than two dozen sources, including ABC News, BBC News, Fox News, ESPN and C-Span. There's plenty of lighter fare, too—a search for Nicole Kidman pulled up a documentary clip from Biography.com and assorted movie reviews and trailers. Blinkx has its own way of indexing clips that makes it more effective than other video search engines for finding particular segments within a broadcast, and each video stream starts off at the point in the segment that's most relevant to your query.

There are tips for businesses too. Run by a San Diego-based nonprofit organization of the same name.</p>

When looking for a job, it's always best to cast a wide net. Each of these job search engines has its own look and feel, but the basic approach is the same: they all trawl the web for relevant job listings based on your search parameters. We ran identical searches on all three, with bountiful results. Each generated a different set of leads, culled from a variety of different sources. including Monster and HotJobs, the two biggest job sites. Might as well have all three help you with the hunt.

Legal Matters<br>
<strong>FindLaw<br></strong>
<a href="www.findlaw.com">www.findlaw.com</a><br>
The For the Public section contains a truckload of information and resources on everything from living wills to bankruptcy to divorce. Other areas are designed for students, businesses and legal professionals. Well-organized, and extremely useful.</p>

<p>
Politics<br>
<strong>Public Agenda</strong><br>
<a href="www.publicagenda.org">www.publicagenda.org</a><br>
Public Agenda is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that conducts public opinion surveys on a variety of hot-button issues, interprets mainstream views and then compares them with the political rhetoric on the right and the left. The site's Issue Guides cover dozens of topics, from abortion to immigration to the right to die.</p>

Web Search<br>
<strong>Clusty<br></strong>
<a href="www.clusty.com">www.clusty.com</a><br>
Google, Yahoo and MSN dominate search, but we're always on the lookout for an innovative approach. This metasearch engine from Vivisimo clusters results by sub-category to help you zero in on what you need—an approach AOL will take on the new aol.com, launching in July (see sidebar). For more cool new search tech, try Grokker, where Yahoo Search query results are displayed as a circular map.
